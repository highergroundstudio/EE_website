We are excited to announce the start of Elevate, a newsletter by Elevated Equities to help you with your commercial debt and equity needs. Each month we will be sending out a newsletter full of information on our company, tips for you, industry-related news, and more. Be sure to look for Elevate in your inbox each month.

Thank you so much for being part of our great client and referral base. We truly enjoy working with you and feel honored to be your chosen lender. You have been such a big part of our success and hopefully we have been part of yours. Being a family office, we are all about family and even though we have many clients we think of you as part of our family. You mean the world to us and your business is much appreciated. It is a true pleasure working with you — you inspire us to do better and that improves our loans and service for thousands of other people! We will do our very best to continue to meet your debt and equity needs. Your continued patronage and suggestions are a vital part of our growth. And for that, we are most grateful. We’re so excited you’ve chosen Elevated Equities — thanks for giving us the opportunity to grow with you. I hope to hear from you soon or see you at one of the conferences we attend.

Thanks again! We look forward to working with you for many years to come.

Best regards,
