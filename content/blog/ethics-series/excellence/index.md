We all strive to be at the top of our game. Could you imagine a company that doesn’t? It would be a disaster from the very beginning. I will conscientiously strive for excellence in my daily work. How is excellence achieved? Excellence in companies is not something that is achieved overnight. It is a quality that is developed over time through hard work and perseverance. How can you help your company reach excellence?

1. **Work with integrity.**

    Over and over, I find integrity to be the base for everything great. It is why it stands alone as one of my code of ethics. I would dive right into why I find integrity so important, but that is an article for another day. I will say that if integrity is not a strong part of your company and who you are then I have one word for you. Enron.

2. **Practice what you preach (inside and outside of work).**

    Nothing is worse than a company that preaches having top-notch customer service to only have to wait for an hour to speak to a person. Deliver on what you are promising. If you are a company that preaches about integrity, then also make sure you are practicing the same thing in your personal life. You cannot live a double life with trying to have strong ethics in your business to only spend your nights lacking any ethics at all.

3. **Be human.**

    Many times companies feel as if to be the best, they must be emotionless. I find this to be the exact opposite. In order to build good rapport with a client you need to be human. They are human too. Connect with them. Have fun. If you lack happiness in your work, customers will be able to sense this. If you make good connections, it will help you to stand out.

4. **Create a strong team.**

    Your foundation is your ethics, but you also need builders to develop a strong company. Pick your team wisely. Do not hire to fill empty spots. Hire creators, not critics. Hire dreamers. Hire people that strive for excellence. When all are on the same page and working towards a common goal, it will create for a strong team.

Strive daily for excellence in all you do. If you focus on creating a strong foundation for your company to stand on, it will make for a strong future.
